# Getting Started with MY-FOOD

Eating good food, especially with family and friends, is one of the pleasures of life. We all know that people who eat healthy, balanced diets are likely to have:

* Plenty of energy to work and enjoy themselve.

* Fewer infections and other illnesses.

The amounts of different nutrients a person needs varies with age, sex, activity and whether menstruating, pregnant or breastfeeding. Needs also vary during sickness and recovery.

- So Why do we need to eat well?


Before answering to this question, we may need to:

1. Find out. What different types of local foods are eaten.

2. Prioritize. Decide which information is most important to share with groups or individual families.

3. Decide whom to reach. Example: parents and other caregivers, teachers, older school children, youths and leaders of community groups.

4. Choose communication methods. For example: illustrated talks, discussions, and demonstrations of foods.


* Actually MY-FOOD is made to answer to those questions and help people make good food choices, here are the basic features:
